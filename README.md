## Summary
The average temperature in Oahu has an approximately 4 degree difference between June and December (74.9 and 71.0 degrees), with lows in December reaching 56, and highs in June reaching 85.

Other data points to query would be wind speed and precipitation as both item can play a factor in the favorability of surfing and ice cream consumption.
